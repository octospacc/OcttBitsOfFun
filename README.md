# OcttBitsOfFun

This repository serves as a miscellaneous depot and workshop of "fun bits", artistical or technical works that would be too messy for me to keep in their own dedicated repo.
In here I simply archive constant updates of these works. Some have kind of a defined purpose to exist, while others might be simple excercises to waste time in a productive way or to study and learn new things.
Feel free to look around and take inspiration, if you will.

## Index + Credits

Index of contents in this repo, might or might not always be complete...
I will also try to credit everyone I can for all the contents listed, when my work is in great part based on someone else's.

* Thanks to <https://github.com/PeterLemon/PSX/tree/master/Cube>:
	* [BouncyCubePs1.asm](BouncyCubePs1.asm)

* Thanks to <https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds/tree/main/hello_world> for the original code structure; all assembly code by me:
	* [HelloWorld-PS1-PsyQ.asm](HelloWorld-PS1-PsyQ.asm)

(For now there's only PSX assembly things in here, this will soon change)
